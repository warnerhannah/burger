# WELCOME TO MY BURGER APPLICATION

This application will allow you to keep a tally of all the burgers that you wish to eat, as well as the burgers that you have already eaten. 

In order to add a burger that you would like to eat to the list, type the name in the "Add a Burger" section and hit "I'm Hungry!"

To check a burger off of your 'to eat' list, click "devour", and the burger will move to your 'eaten' list.
